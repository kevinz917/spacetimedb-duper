## Overview

This is a turn-based strategy game where players compete to control territory on a 7x7 grid. Each player starts with a base tile and can expand their territory through various actions.

## Player Setup

- The game supports 5 players with distinct colors: red, green, yellow, orange, and purple
- Each player starts with:
  - One base tile with 5 troops
